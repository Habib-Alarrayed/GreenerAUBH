# Reflection

In this lab, i leaned how to use GitHub for version control and project management.
I created different branches, multiple commits, and I merged pull requests.

By using feature branches I was able to work on different tasks without affecting the main branch.
I was also able to organize the project into smaller, manageable tasks by creating different issues.

The most challenging part was trying to understanf the layout of GitHub, as it took longer than I thought it was going to take as most of the time I was looking for where I needed to go for a specific task.

If I had more time, I would make the project look better by adding more interactive features, and a progress tracking system.
